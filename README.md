# Facial-monitoring-and-3D-reconstruction
This project aims to develop a software program capable of recognizing facial traits from photos and generate a realistic 3D model of the face. The primary applications for this technology are in the entertainment, medical, and retail industries. The project employs a combination of computer vision, machine learning, and 3D modeling techniques to achieve its objectives. The system workflow consists of several steps, including data acquisition, pre-processing, feature extraction, facial trait classification, and 3D model reconstruction.
