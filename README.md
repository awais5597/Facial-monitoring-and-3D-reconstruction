# Facial-monitoring-and-3D-reconstruction
This project aims to develop a software program capable of recognizing facial traits from photos and generate a realistic 3D model of the face. The primary applications for this technology are in the entertainment, medical, and retail industries. The project employs a combination of computer vision, machine learning, and 3D modeling techniques to achieve its objectives. The system workflow consists of several steps, including data acquisition, pre-processing, feature extraction, facial trait classification, and 3D model reconstruction.
The implementation utilizes the Python programming language and various libraries, such as OpenCV for image processing, Dlib for facial landmark detection, TensorFlow for machine learning, and Open3D for 3D model creation. The CelebA dataset is used to train a convolutional neural network (CNN) for facial trait classification. The system then uses the detected facial landmarks to create a 3D point cloud, which is subsequently visualized using the Plotly library
